A prior analysis of the dataset is available here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space\n-   Dataset source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-04-23/readme.md\n-   The dataset is comprised of 4 columns and 1175 rows - see \"head\" and \"glimpse\" summarized herein.\n-   I choose the dataset because I was thinking it would be interesting to identify the countries launching gadgets into space and the magnitude of the difference between the United States and other countries.\n-   A graphical plot summary of the data is provided below - the plot presents an overview of the dataset and visually displays the number of launches per entity between 1957 and 2023.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# cite: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-04-23/readme.md\n\nouter_space_objects <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-04-23/outer_space_objects.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(outer_space_objects)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1175    4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(outer_space_objects)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  Entity  Code   Year num_objects\n  <chr>   <chr> <dbl>       <dbl>\n1 APSCO   <NA>   2023           1\n2 Algeria DZA    2002           1\n3 Algeria DZA    2010           1\n4 Algeria DZA    2016           3\n5 Algeria DZA    2017           1\n6 Angola  AGO    2017           1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(outer_space_objects)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,175\nColumns: 4\n$ Entity      <chr> \"APSCO\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Ango…\n$ Code        <chr> NA, \"DZA\", \"DZA\", \"DZA\", \"DZA\", \"AGO\", \"AGO\", NA, NA, NA, …\n$ Year        <dbl> 2023, 2002, 2010, 2016, 2017, 2017, 2022, 1985, 1992, 1996…\n$ num_objects <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfiltered_outer_space_objects = outer_space_objects %>%\n  filter (Entity %in% c(\"United States\",\"China\",\"Russia\",\"Japan\",\"France\",\"India\",\"European Space Agency\", \"Germany\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Graphical Summary of the Dataset\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = filtered_outer_space_objects, aes(x=Year, y=num_objects, color = Entity)) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = loess) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"year of launch\",\n    y = \"number of objects launched\",\n    title = \"Number of objects launched into space by year\",\n    subtitle = \"data collected from United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs\",\n    caption = \"objects are defined as satelllites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station flights\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text (size = 10, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, face = \"plain\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, face = \"plain\", hjust = 1),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray90\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = \"gray95\")\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](proposal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Dataset Variable (column) Descriptions\n\n-   The dataset comprises 4 columns and 1175 rows. The dataset summarizes space launch events between 1957 and 2023 as a function of the entity or country responsible for the launch.\n\n-   **Entity**: <character> the country launching the space object\n\n-   **Code**: <character> the type of gadget launched into Earth orbit or beyond (satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station components)\n\n-   **Year**: <double-precision floating-point number> the year of the launch\n\n-   **num_objects**: <double-precision floating-point number> the number of objects launched by \"Entity\" during a year.\n\n## Questions\n\n-   Question 1 - what country is most likely to become the first \"space faring nation\" and is there a close second? I propose to define \"space faring nation\" as the country that launches an order of magnitude more vehicles into space than all other countries combined. I'll fit a polynomial regression model to the dataset by country and extrapolate the model into the future to help identify the likely candidates.\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   The analysis plan is to plot the data on a map and display the launches by country over time. Currently, I have no idea how to do this, create a map, and plot an event from the data set onto the map?\n\n-   I am thinking I will need to get a map of the world with the countries displayed. Another data set with the longitude and latitude for each country may be needed.\n\n-   The launch event data set includes country and number of launches per year, to this I am thinking I will need to add columns defining the longitude and latitude of each launch event.\n\n-   With longitude and latitude defined for each row/event I would then plot the launches on a map.\n\n-   The analysis plan is to have an office hours meetign with Professor Chism the week of June 3rd and discuss how to plot country launch data on a world map. I'll then completed the required learning and apply that new skillset to the launch dataset.\n\n## Detailed Analysis Plan\n\n-   Review with Professor Chism how best to plot data on a world map\n\n-   Use a polynomial regression model to extrapolate the launch data by country into the future for the six most prominant countries\n\n-   Plot the extrapolated dataset onto a world map to identify the most likely country to become a \"Space Faring Nation\".\n\n## Plan of Attack\n\n| Task Name                                        | Status      | Date      | Summary                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Select dataset                                   | complete    | May 27th  | selected the Space Object Launch Dataset                          |\n| Define question to be answered                   | complete    | May 28th  | what country is most likely to become the 1st space faring nation |\n| Submit draft proposal for peer review            | complete    | May 29th  | proposal submitted - comments under review                        |\n| Response to peer review                          | complete    | June 2nd  | peer review comments incorporate into the proposal                |\n| Submit project proposal                          | complete    | June 3rd  | proposal submitted to Professor Chism                             |\n| Office hours with Prof Chism to discuss approach | in-work     | June 9th  | need to learn how to plot launch data on a map?                   |\n| Complete required learning                       | in-work     | June 15th | Reviewed material suggested by Prof. Chism                        |\n| Complete initial analysis of the dataset         | not started | June 15th | Data plotted on a map                                             |\n| draft presentation and writeup                   | not started | June 21st | draft files committed to github                                   |\n| Complete presentation                            | not started | June 23rd | submit to github                                                  |\n| Comlete writeup                                  | not started | June 23rd | submit to github                                                  |\n| final submission                                 | not started | June 24th | submit to github                                                  |\n|                                                  |             |           |                                                                   |\n|                                                  |             |           |                                                                   |\n\n: Approach by Task\n",
