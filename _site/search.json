I propose to define “space faring nation” as the country that launches an order of magnitude more vehicles into space than all other countries combined. I’ll fit a polynomial regression model to the dataset by country and extrapolate the model into the future to help identify the likely candidates."

Currently, I have no idea how to do this, create a map, and plot an event from the data set onto the map?\nI am thinking I will need to get a map of the world with the countries displayed. Another data set with the longitude and latitude for each country may be needed.\nThe launch event data set includes country and number of launches per year, to this I am thinking I will need to add columns defining the longitude and latitude of each launch event.\nWith longitude and latitude defined for each row/event I would then plot the launches on a map.\nThe analysis plan is to have an office hours meetign with Professor Chism the week of June 3rd and discuss how to plot country launch data on a world map. I’ll then completed the required learning and apply that new skillset to the launch dataset."

    "text": "The intent of this project was to understand the evolution of countries engaged in rocket and space technologies and predict countries who will dominate space in the near future. To complete the analysis the dataset “yearly number of objects launched into outer space” was leveraged. The dataset provides the number of objects launched into space from 1957 to 2022 as a function of country. The source of the dataset is the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs and the dataset is available within the tidytuesday package.\nThe analysis was completed in two stages. First, the 1957 to 2022 data was analyzed and plotted as a smooth line plot by country and on a world map, see Figures 1 and 2 respectively. These two plots document the early years of the rocket technology and highlight the dominance of Russia during the infancy of rocket technology, see Figure 2. The static smooth line plots and the interactive maps used to tell the space faring story were created using ggplot2 and the Plotly package respectively.\nThe 1957 to 2022 data was employed to identify the fifteen prominent space faring nations, the countries with the largest number of objects launched. For each of these fifteen countries a second order polynomial regression model was calculated. The country model was utilized to create a second dataset and predict launches between 2001 and 2022 and extrapolate the number of objects launched up to the year 2100. The results of the model and predicted number of launches are displayed on a static ggplot smooth line plot and an interactive world map, see Figures 3 and 4.\nThe analysis indicates that Russia, once a dominant force in space technologies will fail to keep pace with other nations eventually losing its ability to launch space objects. The work suggests that the United States will dominate space and that China will replace Russia as an important contributor to the industry. The analysis indicates Britian will be an important player in future space endeavors, and India will rise as the forth most active nation with respect to launching objects into space."

To accomplish the tasks the original dataset, launch events by country as a function of year, was plotted on a ggplot geom_smooth() plot with year on the x-axis and the number of events on the y-axis, see Figure 1. To enable the user to interact with the dataset the data was also plotted on an interactive map, where a slider displayed launch data for a selected year, and by using a mouse to hover over a country launch data for that country could be displayed, see Figure 2. Both figures 1 and 2 provided insight into the evolution of the space launch industry and helped identify dominant countries. The tidytuesday space_launch_objects dataset was leveraged to create a second order polynomial model for the fifteen most dominant countries. The model was used to predict launch events by country for the fifteen selected countries for the period 2001 to 2100. That regression model was used to generate a new dataset “extrapolated_data” that stored the predicted launch event numbers by country. The “extrapolated_data” was then plotted on a smooth line plot, with years (2001 to 2100) on the x-axis, and the number of launch events on the y-axis, see Figure 3. The extrapolated_data was also plotted on an interactive map, see Figure 4. Using the map uses can select a year using a slider, see the number of total launch events on an evolving scale, and hover over one of the fifteen select countries to see specific launch data for a selected year."

    "text": "Analysis\nThe dataset “outer_space_objects” was loaded from the tidytuesday package and dplyr functions used to remove rows with missing data and, create the “hover” column to support the interactive map, and remove a categorical variable “world” from the “entity” column. Removing the “world” data reduced the dataset to include only country data for launched objects. The dataset provided the number of space vehicle launches by country between 1957 and 2023. The dataset was plotted on a static ggplot smooth line plot and an interactive map using ggplot2 and plotly respectively, see Figures 1 and 2.\nCreating the first plot, the smooth line plot in ggplot2, required reducing the number of countries to 11 to support the scale_color_brewer palette limitations, see Figure 1. The dplyr package and the pipe function was used to isolate the eleven most active countries and then separate out that dataset from the original “outer_space_objects” dataset. A smooth line plot was used to display launches by country for the time period 1957 to 2023 for the eleven most active countries, see Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make things a little more interesting, enable some interaction with the data, the “outer_space_objects” dataset has been displayed on an interactive map, see Figure 2. Launch data for all countries in the “outer_space_objects” dataset is displayed on the map as a function of year and country, see Figure 2. Users can use the bar slider at the base of the map to see launch events per year by country. Hovering over a country displays the number of launch events in the year selected by the slider. The year selected on the sliding bar scale is displayed on the top right of the slider graphic. There is also a play function for the slider to the left. The interactive map was created using plotly after a lot of reading and watching an excellent YouTube video on the package, see citation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intent of the analysis was to determine what countries would dominate space launch events in the future. To answer the question a original “outer_space_objects” dataset was used to calculate a second order polynomial regression model for the fifteen most active countries. The model was used to predict the number of launch events as a function of year for each country. To accomplish this task a new dataset was created (new_data) with years 2001 to 2100 and the tibble() to hold the final data initialized (extrapolated_data). The fifteen most active countries were separated from the “outer_space_objects” dataset using dplyr pipe function (top_15_countries) and the country code added (country_plus_code) to enable the interactive map. Dplyr pipe functions significantly reduced the complexity of these tasks, prior to this class I would have used a lot of loops. A combination of a loop with embedded dplyr pipe functions was utilized to (a) select data for a country, (b) apply a polynomial model to that country data, (c) create the predicted launch data (y_pred) for the selected country, and (d) assemble all the data into one dataset “extrapolated_data” using the bind_rows function. Dplyr pipe functions were utilized again to create the final “extrapolated_data” dataset by renaming columns, setting negative y_pred value to zero, create the data for the hover column, and removing the non-country data i.e. “world”.\nThe predicted launch data from 2001 to 2100 is displayed on a ggplot2, geom_smooth(), smooth line plot, see Figure 3. To display all fifteen countries the scale_color_brewer was removed from the code, that palette was limited to displaying eleven categorical variables. A review of available palettes did not identify an alternative capable of assigning high contract colors to fifteen variables within a category; as a result, the default was used. The colors displayed are not the best, the contrast is weak, but the only other option was to reduce the number of countries displayed from fifteen to eleven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interactive map displaying predicted space launch events between 2001 and 2023, see Figure 4. The data displayed between 2001 and 2023 are predicted events based on the regression model, not actual launch events. The data 2024 to 2100 is the modeling extrapolating the data from 1957 to 2023 into the future. The map was created using Plotly and the “extrapolated_data” generated from the regression model. Within Plotly; plot_geo defines the type of plot – a world map in this instance. The add_trace functionality defines the variable tracked by the scale bar at the bottom of the plot. The layout definition describes the fonts, colors of land and oceans, the borders between countries, etc."

A prior analysis of the dataset is available here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space\nDataset source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-04-23/readme.md\nThe dataset is comprised of 4 columns and 1175 rows - see “head” and “glimpse” summarized herein.\nI choose the dataset because I was thinking it would be interesting to identify the countries launching gadgets into space and the magnitude of the difference between the United States and other countries.\nFigure 1: A static graphical plot summary of the data - the plot presents an overview of the dataset and visually displays the number of launches per entity between 1957 and 2023.\nFigure 2: A dynamic world map - move the slider located on the bottom of the map graphic from 1957 to 2023 to see highlighted countries launching space vehicles each year.\n\n\n\n(II) Space Objects Predicted (2001 to 2100)\n\nThe origian dataset was used to identify the fifteen most active countries launching gadgets into space.\nA second order polynomial Y (number of objects) = function (interectp + year + year^2) for the fifteen most active countries was calculated.\nThe model was used to predict the number of launches between 2001 and 2023 and extrapolate the number of launches up to year 2100.\nThe data generated by the model was stored in a dataset called “extrapolated_data”\nIt was this extrapolated dataset that I was most interested in to understand tends in the industry\nThe “extrapolated_data” included five columns (i) Year, (ii) predicted_launches, (iii) Entity, (iv) Code, and (v) hover\nEntity was the country launching gadgets into space - nomenclature carry over from original dataset\nCode was the country code needed for identifying the “entity” on the map\nhover was the information displayed when the mouse is hovering over a country on the interactive map\nFigure 3: A static graphical smooth line plot of the predicted and extrapolated data from 2001 to 2100.\nFigure 4: A dynamic map, zoom in and move around the map, there is a slider located at the base of the map, move the slider to display predicted launch events from 2001 to 2100.\n\n\n\nData Variable Descriptions: (I) The Space Objects Dataset (1957 to 2023)\nThe dataset comprises 4 columns and 1175 rows. The dataset summarizes space launch events between 1957 and 2023 as a function of the entity or country responsible for the launch.\nEntity:  the country launching the space object\nCode:  the type of gadget launched into Earth orbit or beyond (satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station components)\nYear:  the year of the launch\nnum_objects:  the number of objects launched by “Entity” during a year.\n\n\nData Variable Descriptions: (II) The Space Objects Predicted (2001 to 2100)\nThe extrapolated_data dataset comprises 5 columns. The dataset summarizes predicted space launch events from 2001 to 2100 using the second order polynomial regression model generated from the original “space objects dataset”.\nYear:  the year of the launch\npredicted_launches:  the number of objects launched by “Entity” during a year.\nEntity:  the country launching the space object\nCode:  the type of gadget launched into Earth orbit or beyond (satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station components)\nhover:  text used on the interactve map when hovering over a country. Displays country name and number of launch events for year selected using the sliding scale at the base of the map."

    "text": "Question 1: What nation is likely to dominate space in the not so distant future?\nQuestion 1 - what country is most likely to become the first “space faring nation” and is there a close second? I propose to define “space faring nation” as the country that launches an order of magnitude more vehicles into space than all other countries combined. I’ll fit a polynomial regression model to the dataset by country and extrapolate the model into the future to help identify the likely candidates."

The year of launch was plotted on the x-axis and the total number of launches in each year on the y-axis., see Figure 1.\nFigure 1 was limited to displaying eleven countries due to the limiations of the color pallete. As a result, the dataset was sorted and the eleven prominant countries displayed, see Figure 1.\nThe initial dataset was also plotted on an interactive map using Plotly. A moving scale allows the user to select a year between 1957 and 2023 - hovering over a country then displays the number of launches for that country in the selected year.\nThe fifteen most active countries were selected to make future forecast of space launch activities.\nA second order polynomial model was fitted to each of the fifteen countries and their launch activity between 2001 and 2100 predicted.\nPredicted launch activity is displayed on a static smooth line plot for the fifteen selected countries, see Figure 3.\nAn interactive map was generated to display the predicted launch volume by country for each of the fifteen selected countries, see Figure 4."
