I propose to define “space faring nation” as the country that launches an order of magnitude more vehicles into space than all other countries combined. I’ll fit a polynomial regression model to the dataset by country and extrapolate the model into the future to help identify the likely candidates."

Currently, I have no idea how to do this, create a map, and plot an event from the data set onto the map?\nI am thinking I will need to get a map of the world with the countries displayed. Another data set with the longitude and latitude for each country may be needed.\nThe launch event data set includes country and number of launches per year, to this I am thinking I will need to add columns defining the longitude and latitude of each launch event.\nWith longitude and latitude defined for each row/event I would then plot the launches on a map.\nThe analysis plan is to have an office hours meetign with Professor Chism the week of June 3rd and discuss how to plot country launch data on a world map. I’ll then completed the required learning and apply that new skillset to the launch dataset."
